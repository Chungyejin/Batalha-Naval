1st semester assignment - Programming a ship game using Python

# Description
The player will face the computer. First, the game begins when each player selects where they want to place their ships (the computer's ships are placed randomly).

If you select a location where the opposing team's ships are likely to be, an x ​​will appear at that location if there is a ship at that position and you will be given another chance to choose. If there is not, an o will appear at that location and the opportunity will go to the opponent.

The first player to sink all of the opposing team's ships wins.
